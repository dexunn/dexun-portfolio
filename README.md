# 🏎️ Dexun Han - Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website showcasing my background, experience, and projects, designed with a motorsport-inspired “lap” concept and built using modern frontend tools.

🔗 **Live site:** [https://dexunn.github.io](https://dexunn.github.io/dexun-portfolio/))
📌 **Status:** Actively maintained

---

## ✨ Overview

This portfolio is designed as a **race lap metaphor**, where each section represents a lap in my development journey:

* **Lap 01 — About**
* **Lap 02 — Experience**
* **Lap 03 — Tech Stack**
* **Lap 04 — Projects**
* **End of Race — Footer**

Subtle telemetry elements such as a lap counter, timing lines, and gradient accents are used to create a clean but distinctive visual identity.

* **React** (Vite)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
